# backup-tmodloader-mods
This repository is simply a backup of mods installed via tmodloader. I may delete this repo when I get a working server with mirrors, because using git as a backup system is silly when it's on github.
Also I'm pretty sure this doesn't violate the ToS, but submit an issue starting with "\[VIOLATION\]" and i'll reread the terms.
